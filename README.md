# Web Development Teaching Repository

Welcome to the Web Development Teaching Repository! This repository is designed to provide a structured, hands-on learning experience for aspiring web developers.

## How to Approach This Course

This course is structured into daily modules. For each day, you should:

1.  **Start with the Outline:** Navigate to the `outline` directory and read the markdown file for the corresponding day (e.g., `day_1.md`). This will provide you with the theoretical concepts and an overview of the topics.
2.  **Do the Exercises:** After understanding the concepts, go to the `exercise` directory and find the folder for that day. Follow the `README.md` inside to complete the practical exercises. Solutions are provided in the `solution` sub-directory if you get stuck.
3.  **Work on the Project:** The `project` directory contains a larger, ongoing project that will be built upon the skills you learn each day.
